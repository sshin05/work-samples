                <p>THE WORLD HAS WAITED AN EXTRA YEAR for the Tokyo 2020 summer games but skateboarders have waited even longer. This year marks the sport’s Olympics debut and its athletes and fans—used to being sidelined—are feeling something between elation and collective disbelief. Among them is 21-year-old Sophie Grant, a London, Ont. native who landed her first trick barely five years ago.</p>
 
                <p>This summer, when Sophie might otherwise be camping or cliff-jumping, she’ll be training 12-hour days, which inevitably means injuries. But she says, as the middle sister between two boys, she was made for it. “Part of me enjoys the pain that comes with this. I like looking down at my hands and arms full of blood and thinking, you went through all that to land your trick. And you got it. That’s sick.”</p>

                <p>Her itch for competition started just three years ago at the Wheels of Fortune skateboarding showcase in Seattle. “I didn’t even place, but I noticed that I was able to push through the pressure,” she recalls. And she loved hearing people scream her name. “The adrenaline rush is insane. I thought: I want to get good at this, I want this to be my career.”</p>

                <p>With skateboarding, Sophie says, “every single time you head out, you’re trying to do a bigger trick than you’ve done before.” She describes climbing out of the intense fear into another headspace. “I basically do a miniature meditation before I try something new. You’ve kind of got to be fearless. Because if you hesitate, even for a second, that’s when you get hurt.” And, Sophie says, there’s an upshot to that daring. “With lack of fear comes style. I’m able to land my tricks and look good doing it.”</p>

                <p>For four years, Sophie has decamped to Southern California each winter to train among top pros. Each summer she returns home to apply what she’s learned. “But skateboarding style can’t be defined by where you live,” she says.  “It’s almost like DNA. You can only make it up yourself.” Same goes for personal style. On off hours Sophie says she wears retro denim, a designer backpack, a choker, and always some chains. Her sport version isn’t too different: “I still like to have my jewellery for sure – I got my little chains on and my earrings and my rings. Honestly, when I’m dressing nice, and I feel like I’m looking cool, I just skate better.”</p>
