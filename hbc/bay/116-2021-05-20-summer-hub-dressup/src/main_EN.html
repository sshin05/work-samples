                <p>AT ANY GIVEN FASHION SHOOT, THERE'S only a few roles Lauren Chan hasn’t played. Model, check – she was signed right after college. Magazine editor, yep. As a Glamour staffer she brought plus-size-inclusivity stories to the forefront of modern media. Fashion brand exec – yes again. Her Henning line makes elevated workwear staples for women size 12+. The professional trajectory of the Brantford, Ont. native doesn’t reflect a single theme so much as a mission. “My goal is more about helping women who feel marginalized and excluded feel equal, and commanding, and capable,” she says. “And I hope my career will have many expressions of that.”</p>

            <p><u>HUDSON’S BAY</u> No matter your job, you’ve been using your voice to bring awareness to important issues, from Asian hate to the outdated “beauty ideal,” to inclusive sizing. When did you start seizing that opportunity to speak out? </p>

            <p><u>LAUREN CHAN</u> When I first started writing about my experience a few years after school, the feedback was strong – folks would reach out, share on social, or write letters to the editor. I started gathering a community around me. There’s power in being different and sharing it. We all fall into the trap thinking that we’re completely alone, but you have to make efforts to find a community that supports you instead of reinforcing the negative ideas that we’ve grown up with. What makes you different is your superpower, that’s one of the truest things I know. </p>

                <p><u>HB</u> What does that look like on a practical level? </p>
                <p><u>LC</u> First, when you’re scrolling on your phone, recognize how you feel. When you come across an account or post that makes you feel crappy, just mute or unfollow them. Likewise, consider the power of curating your social feed in a way that inverts the beauty idea. The media and entertainment industries have come a long way in terms of representing more diversity, but we need to follow people who look different than us, too.</p>
                <p><u>HB</u> What’s your mindset when you’re getting dressed these days? </p>
                <p><u>LC</u> We know clothes have the power to affect how we feel. There are days getting dressed can feel like a chore and there are sunny days when I want my outfit to reflect my energy and excitement. But, even for me, comfy doesn’t mean sweats and tube socks. I  like to feel put-together so I’ll wear a button-down with a collar. And wearing slides or loafers sometimes makes me feel like I’m ready to leave the house. </p>

                <p><u>HB</u> With 10 years down, you’re technically a New Yorker now. Do you feel like one? </p>
                <p><u>LC</u> I never felt so intensely or passionately Canadian until I moved to the States. Here, I can see the nuances of what it meant to be a Canadian – how Canadians address strangers on the sidewalk or how we think of politics in ways that are empathetic and progressive. Those are huge pride points for me.  </p>
                <p><u>HB</u> Paint a typical summer moment for us. </p>
                <p><u>LC</u> We have a dog, Pepper, and so we chose to live near the park. We knew it’d be good for her, but I don’t think we knew how good it would be for us. If I’m out and around the neighbourhood I’ll be in a bowling shirt, bathing suit, jean shorts, and Birkenstocks. I pretty much exclusively wear those things in summer! I don’t want to feel uncomfortable in pants – that’s against my ethos! Knee-length shorts are my favourite, so I love that they’re in style.</p>
