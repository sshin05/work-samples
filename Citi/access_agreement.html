		<p><span class="bold">This ELECTRONIC ACCESS AGREEMENT</span> contains the terms and conditions under which you and your employer ("<u>your Firm</u>") are provided with access to the Platform and are permitted to use the products and services offered on the Platform (collectively, the "<u>Services</u>"), such as the information, research, data, analytical tools, models, calculators, software, photographs, video, audio, graphics and other content available on the Platform (collectively, the "<u>Platform Content</u>").</p>

<p>1. <span class="bold">Construction of Agreement.</span> References to "<u>you</u>" and "<u>your</u>" are to both you, as an individual, and to your Firm, unless expressly stated otherwise, and references to "<u>we</u>" or "<u>us</u>" or "<u>our</u>" are to Citigroup. The term "<u>Agreement</u>" includes the body of this Agreement, all supplements you execute containing terms applicable to a particular Service (each, a "<u>Supplement</u>"), all Schedules and any disclosures, legends or disclaimers posted on or in connection with the Services, each of which is incorporated herein and made part of this Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and any Instructions (as defined below) are deemed to be "in writing" and to have been "executed" for all purposes and will have the same legally binding nature, validity and enforceability as if each were originated, executed and maintained in paper form. This Agreement supplements all applicable agreements between you and us, including your account agreement(s) and any trade confirmations. Solely in connection with your use of any Service, in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any other agreement between you and us, the terms of this Agreement shall control. We will give you prior notice of any Supplement, Schedule or amendment to this Agreement, and the foregoing will not be effective against you until executed by you.</p>

<p>2. <span class="bold">License to Services.</span> We grant to you, subject to the terms of this Agreement, a revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable personal license to use the Services for your Firm∆s internal business purposes and only for as long as you are (a) an employee of your Firm; (b) designated by your Firm as an authorized representative for the purposes hereof; and (c) approved by us to use the Services (an "<u>Authorized User</u>"). You may not permit any other person who is not an Authorized User of your Firm to access or use the Services.</p>

<p>3. <span class="bold">Provision and Use of Services.</span> We retain exclusive control over the Services, and reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to (a) terminate access to all or any portion of the Services by you, as an individual, or your Firm for cause at any time; and (b) change, suspend or discontinue all or any portion of the Services on reasonable notice to you.
